This repository explores the use of traditional Reinforcement Learning *temporal-difference* methods such as the  [Q-learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q-learning) algorithm to understand how agents can learn to navigate to the source of a 2D turbulent odor plume. Turbulent odor plumes are spatiotemporally complex: odor signals arrive in random, unpredictable bursts, and odor concentration does follow continuous gradients, making plume navigation a difficult task. Surprisingly, there has been no published work on applying RL algorithms to turbulent odor plume navigation.
